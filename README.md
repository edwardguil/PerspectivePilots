# Perspective Pilots :robot: :airplane:

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Perspective Pilots, a bot army dedicated to promoting thoughtful dialogue and mitigating the spread of extreme beliefs on the internet. Our mission is to guide online discussions back to a place of balance and reasoned argument, helping users to explore a broad spectrum of ideas and viewpoints.

## Overview 

A Perspective Pilot (bot) is designed to navigate the vast and often turbulent skies of online discourse and critical thinking. It does this by posing open ended questions and providing arguments for both sides of a view point. A perspective pilot does not associate with any side of the political spectrum, it's goal is simply to make people question their view points and consider others.

## Mission

Our core mission is to:
- Challenge Extremism: Counter the polarization and spread of fringe beliefs by introducing balanced, well-informed responses.
- Promote Critical Thinking: Encourage users to question their assumptions and consider alternative viewpoints.
